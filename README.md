# Teach Yo Self
-----------------
For todays teach your self lesson I went with React Native.

# Reach Native
-----------------
React Native is a react library designed and developed by Facebook in March 2015. What React Native allows you to do is create mobile apps for ios and andriod without having to know their native programing languages through React. Native is able to accomplish this because it is written in	JavaScript, Java, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Python. Essentially allowing its to translate your code to any language it needs to.

# Why I chose React Native
-----------------
My goal is to turn two of my projects into mobile apps at a later date. I wanted to learn how to make apps in a programming language I already know. Once learning about React Native I was facinated to learn that React Native allows you to do just that by converting your code into the language it needs to be in without you knowing either of the "native" languages for ios and andriod.

# My Code
-----------------
I wrote very little code for this what you primarily see are the files that come when you install React Native. The only depencies you need outside of that are https://expo.io/ and Xcode which you need to run the localservers to test your code. They also offer a web based app that allows you to test your code without having to publish it via expo.
